Task Description

Your task is to perform a refactoring change in a Python project. A function needs to be renamed.
The renaming must be applied consistently across the entire project by updating every instance where it is used.

Please note:
1. The code must still function perfectly after the renaming.
2. All imports, references, and function calls must be updated accordingly.
3. The style, formatting, and structure of the code must be preserved.
4. Do not introduce any new functionality, logic changes, or unrelated formatting changes.
5. For every modified file, return the complete updated file content to ensure that no changes are overlooked.
6. The semantics and behavior of the code must not change.
7. Only include files that required changes due to the renaming.

This includes (if applicable):
- Imports
- Function calls
- Type hints
- Decorators
- References inside docstrings or comments that explicitly refer to the renamed function

Do not resolve naming conflicts automatically. If a conflict would occur, report it instead.

Examples of renaming tasks:

Example 1:

Original Code:
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b

print(calculate_sum(2, 3))

Task:
1. Rename the function `calculate_sum` to `add`.
2. Update every relevant occurrence across the entire project.

Output format (for EACH modified file):

File `filename.py`:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(2, 3))
```

Example 2:

Original Code:
def find_maximum(numbers):
return max(numbers)

result = find_maximum([1, 2, 3])

Task:

Rename the function find_maximum to get_max.

Update every relevant occurrence across the entire project.

Output format (for EACH modified file):

File filename.py:
```python
def get_max(numbers):
    return max(numbers)

result = get_max([1, 2, 3])

```

Your Task:

Rename the function reset_all in the file ansitowin32.py to reset_console.

Update every relevant occurrence across the entire project.

Output:

For EACH modified file, respond exactly in the following format:

File filename.py:
```python
[Complete updated file content]
```
